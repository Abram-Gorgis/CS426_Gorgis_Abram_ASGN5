# CS426_Gorgis_Abram_ASGN5

2 Phsyics constructs:
Jump pads with collision on player launches player into air.

Bullets bounce off walls instead of glidding along.

Billboard:
Used image of a "bug" in the system put random bugs around the map that follow the player

Lights:
Added red led lights to computer case to illuminate arena

Added lamp to top of desk that shines into arena giving nice affect

Sound:
Shooting makes a sound of bow now

picking up ammo is a sound as well


The billboard I had to figure out on my own as no guide online had an example with the camera being on the player prefab.

Sound based on this guide: https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/206116386-How-do-I-play-multiple-Audio-Sources-from-one-GameObject-

Lights and physics I did on my own as they are built in features of unity that ive used in the past
